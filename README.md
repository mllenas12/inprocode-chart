# Inprocode

Inprocode is a simple app that allows you to track your daily expenses displayed in a chart. You can also view the total amount spent during the week and the difference in expenses between the current day and the previous day.

By clicking the arrow button, you can navigate to the next or previous week's data.
Additionally, you have the option to switch the language to Catalan, Spanish or English.

This app uses varios dependencies such as Chart.js for displaying charts, i18n for implementing multilingual support, and SonarCloud for improving code quality.

Try it out for yourself [here](https://inprocode-chart.vercel.app/)!
